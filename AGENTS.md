## Argument
1. Store all the data locally on the user's device to ensure privacy and security. Use the Chrome Storage API for this purpose.
2. Implement a notification system that alerts users when they are approaching their set time limits for specific websites.
3. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily set and adjust their time limits for different websites. This is should be available in the extension homepage.
4. Develop a reporting feature that provides users with detailed insights into their browsing activity in the home page.
5. Allow users to customize their settings for different days of the week, enabling them to have different time limits based on their schedule.
6. Ensure that the extension is easy to install and configure, with clear instructions provided in the extension's documentation.
7. Encourage community contributions by providing guidelines for forking the repository, creating branches, and submitting pull requests.
8. License the extension under the MIT License to promote open-source collaboration and usage.
9. Provide support channels, such as GitHub Issues, for users to report bugs or request features.

## Homepage
1. Homepage shows the activity for today with a list of websites visited and the time spent on each.
2. There is a sidebar that user can access to navigate to Settings and Reports pages.
